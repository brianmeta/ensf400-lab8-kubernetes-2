## **_Step 1_** - Setup

Immediately after entering the code space, I first started the minikube with the command:

```bash
$ minikube start
```

**Output**

```
üòÑ minikube v1.32.0 on Ubuntu 20.04 (docker/amd64)
‚ú® Using the docker driver based on existing profile
üëç Starting control plane node minikube in cluster minikube
...
```

I then enabled ingress add-on using the command:

```bash
$ minikube addons enable ingress
```

**Output**

```
üí°  ingress is an addon maintained by Kubernetes. For any concerns contact minikube on GitHub.
You can view the list of minikube maintainers at: https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/blob/master/OWNERS

## **_Step 2_** - Create resources for Nginx LoadBalancers

Now that the code space has been setup, we are ready to create the resources required to create the Nginx LoadBalancer using the config files.

To begin, I created the deployment using the command:

```bash
$ kubectl create -f ./config-files/nginx-dep.yaml
deployment.apps/nginx-dep created
```

To check that all 5 pods are running, you can then use the command:

```bash
$ kubectl get po
NAME                         READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
nginx-dep-86b95db777-6gvg6   1/1     Running   0          19s
nginx-dep-86b95db777-gj6gr   1/1     Running   0          19s
nginx-dep-86b95db777-nchsh   1/1     Running   0          19s
nginx-dep-86b95db777-x8v88   1/1     Running   0          19s
nginx-dep-86b95db777-z8c8z   1/1     Running   0          19s
```

I then created the service and ingress using the following commands (in the same order):

```bash
$ kubectl create -f ./config-files/nginx-svc.yaml
service/nginx-svc created
```

```bash
$ kubectl create -f ./config-files/nginx-ingress.yaml
ingress.networking.k8s.io/nginx-ingress created
```

## **_Step 3_** - Create resources for Apps

I first created all the resources for app-1, by executing the commands below in the same order.

1. ```bash
   $ kubectl create -f ./config-files/app-1-configs/app-1-dep.yaml
   deployment.apps/app-1 created
   ```

1. ```bash
   $ kubectl create -f ./config-files/app-1-configs/app-1-svc.yaml
   service/app-1-svc created
   ```

1. ```bash
   $ kubectl create -f ./config-files/app-1-configs/app-1-ingress.yaml
   ingress.networking.k8s.io/app-1-ingress created
   ```

I then did the same for app-2, by executing the commands in below in the same order.

1. ```bash
   $ kubectl create -f ./config-files/app-2-configs/app-2-dep.yaml
   deployment.apps/app-2 created
   ```

1. ```bash
   $ kubectl create -f ./config-files/app-2-configs/app-2-svc.yaml
   service/app-2-svc created
   ```

1. ```bash
   $ kubectl create -f ./config-files/app-2-configs/app-2-ingress.yaml
   ingress.networking.k8s.io/app-2-ingress created
   ```

## **_Step 4_** - Results

Now that all of the resources have been created, I used the command below to check if I configured the applications correctly.

```bash
   $ curl http://$(minikube ip)/
```

### FIXME: SCREENSHOT RESULTS GO HERE

## **_Step 5_** - Clean Up

Now that the assignment has been completed, I deleted all the resources using the commands below.

```bash
$ kubectl delete -f ./config-files/nginx-dep.yaml
deployment.apps "nginx-dep" deleted

$ kubectl delete -f ./config-files/nginx-svc.yaml
service "nginx-svc" deleted

$ kubectl delete -f ./config-files/nginx-ingress.yaml
ingress.networking.k8s.io "nginx-ingress" deleted

$ kubectl delete -f ./config-files/app-2-configs/app-2-ingress.yaml
ingress.networking.k8s.io "app-2-ingress" deleted

$ kubectl delete -f ./config-files/app-2-configs/app-2-svc.yaml
service "app-2-svc" deleted

$ kubectl delete -f ./config-files/app-2-configs/app-2-dep.yaml
deployment.apps "app-2" deleted

$ kubectl delete -f ./config-files/app-1-configs/app-1-ingress.yaml
ingress.networking.k8s.io "app-1-ingress" deleted

$ kubectl delete -f ./config-files/app-1-configs/app-1-svc.yaml
service "app-1-svc" deleted

$ kubectl delete -f ./config-files/app-1-configs/app-1-dep.yaml
deployment.apps "app-1" deleted
```
